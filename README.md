# Valladolid Snooker Club
## Project Overview
Valladolid Snooker Club is a website that has the objective of attracting more people to take up playing Snooker and see the beneficial and fun aspects of it.  It facilitates users with the possibility to meet at the venue and share their passion for the sport regardless of their age or skill.

This website aims to appeal to the local audience and encourage them to participate in an ever-growing multi-cultural sport that their country has yet to discover whether it is seeking a hobby after work or meeting with friends.  There are also many UK residents currently residing in the city who share a passion for the sport, and could greatly benefit from having a place which offers them an opportunity to continue playing what they love.

Valladolid Snooker Club also offers classes to kids at a very convenient time for parents to enroll their children seeing as after-school activities are very popular in the city. It simultaneously provides them a method to further develop their motor skills and concentration skills, and learn about a new sport which could potentially develop into a professional career.
